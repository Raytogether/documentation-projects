# Comprehensive Maintenance Plan

Regular maintenance is essential to ensure our backup systems remain reliable and functional. This plan outlines the schedule and procedures for maintaining all backup components.

## Daily Operations

Daily maintenance tasks ensure continuous backup operation:

- **Automated checks**: Scripts verify completion of scheduled backups
- **Log review**: Scan logs for errors or warnings
- **Space monitoring**: Verify sufficient storage on local systems
- **Email notifications**: Automated alerts for any issues

Example daily check script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check backup status
if ! grep "Backup completed successfully" /var/log/backup.log; then
  echo "Backup issue detected" | mail -s "Backup Alert" admin@example.com
fi
```

## Weekly Verification

Weekly tasks focus on deeper verification:

- **Backup integrity**: Verify random files from backups
- **Test restores**: Restore sample files to test recovery
- **System updates**: Apply updates to backup software
- **Configuration review**: Verify backup configurations

Weekly tasks are scheduled for Saturday mornings.

## Monthly Testing

Monthly operations focus on more comprehensive testing:

- **Full restore test**: Complete restore of critical systems
- **Performance optimization**: Adjust backup scheduling if needed
- **Storage cleanup**: Remove unnecessary temporary files
- **Documentation review**: Update procedures as needed

Monthly maintenance occurs on the first weekend of each month.

## Quarterly Audit

Quarterly operations provide a complete system review:

- **Strategy review**: Evaluate overall backup strategy
- **Compliance check**: Verify backup meets all requirements
- **Disaster recovery test**: Full DR scenario testing
- **Budget review**: Evaluate costs and optimize as needed

Quarterly audits are conducted in January, April, July, and October.
