# Introduction to Our Backup Strategy

## Overview

Modern data protection requires a comprehensive backup strategy that addresses multiple failure scenarios and recovery needs. Our multi-layered approach provides:

- **Data Security** through encryption and off-site storage
- **Recovery Flexibility** with multiple recovery methods
- **System Redundancy** through diverse backup solutions
- **Operational Simplicity** with automation and clear procedures

## Key Components

Our backup strategy consists of three main components:

### 1. Primary Automated Systems

Duplicity and Borg provide our core automated backup functionality:

- **Duplicity**: Encrypted incremental backups to B2 cloud storage
- **Borg**: Efficient, deduplicated backups with fast recovery options
- **Automated scripts**: Scheduled via cron for consistent operation
- **Monitoring**: Automated verification and notification systems

### 2. Dropbox Standalone System

Dropbox provides a manual cloud storage option:

- **Manual workflow**: Simple drag-and-drop operation
- **Multi-device access**: Files available across all devices
- **Sharing capabilities**: Easy collaboration on select files
- **Version history**: Limited file versioning built-in

### 3. DeJa Dup Google Drive Integration

DeJa Dup provides a simple GUI backup solution:

- **User-friendly interface**: Simple backup and restore operations
- **Google Drive storage**: Integration with Google's cloud infrastructure
- **Scheduled backups**: Automatic protection of user directories
- **Easy recovery**: Simplified restore process

## Implementation Principles

Our backup strategy follows these core principles:

1. **Defense in depth**: Multiple backup systems protect against various failure modes
2. **Automation first**: Regular backups happen automatically
3. **Verification is essential**: All backups are regularly verified
4. **Documentation matters**: Clear procedures for all backup operations
