# Dropbox Standalone System

Our Dropbox implementation provides a manual cloud storage solution separate from our automated backup systems.

## Overview

Dropbox serves as a complementary manual backup system with these key characteristics:

- **Manual workflow**: Files are manually copied to Dropbox
- **No automation**: Separate from cron-scheduled backups
- **Multi-device access**: Files available on all connected devices
- **Simple recovery**: Direct file access for quick recovery

## Alias and Function Management

We use shell aliases and functions to streamline Dropbox operations:

```bash
# Example Dropbox aliases
alias dbx='cd ~/Dropbox'
alias dbxls='ls -la ~/Dropbox'
alias dbxsync='dropbox status'
```

These shortcuts provide quick access to common Dropbox operations.

## Which Command Integration

Our system integrates Dropbox with the `which` command for command location:

```bash
# Example which command integration
which dropbox    # Shows path to dropbox binary
which dbx        # Shows alias definition
```

## Shell Functions for Backup

Custom shell functions enhance Dropbox backup capabilities:

```bash
# Example backup function
function backup_to_dropbox() {
  local src="$1"
  local dest="$HOME/Dropbox/Backups/$(basename "$src")"
  echo "Backing up $src to $dest"
  cp -r "$src" "$dest"
}
```

These functions provide consistent backup operations across different systems.

## Quick Reference

For quick reference, use these common Dropbox commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `dbx` | Change to Dropbox directory |
| `dbxls` | List Dropbox contents |
| `dbxsync` | Check Dropbox sync status |
| `backup_to_dropbox [file]` | Back up file to Dropbox |
