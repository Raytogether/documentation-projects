## Introduction

This documentation details a comprehensive code backup solution implemented to protect and manage source code through multiple layers of protection. The system combines Git version control, GitHub remote repositories, and local Borg backups to create a robust backup strategy with:

- Granular version history through Git
- Off-site backup through GitHub
- Point-in-time snapshots through Borg
- Automated daily backups

This guide serves both as documentation of the implemented system and as a learning resource for Git, version control best practices, and backup strategies for code projects.

## System Components

The code backup system consists of three primary layers:

1. **Git Version Control**: Local Git repositories for each code project in the `~/code/` directory, providing detailed version history and change tracking.

2. **GitHub Remote Repositories**: Remote copies of all repositories under the username `Raytogether`, providing off-site backup and collaboration capabilities.

3. **Borg Backup**: A local encrypted backup repository that creates point-in-time snapshots of all code directories, stored at `~/borg-repos/code-backup`.

Additionally, the system includes automated scripts for daily backups and repository management, ensuring consistency and reliability.
