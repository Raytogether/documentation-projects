# Warp Session Management Guide

## Why Use Session Management Instead of Auto-Recording

While automatic recording of all Warp terminal sessions might seem convenient, it comes with several drawbacks:

1. **Storage Bloat**: Automatic recording creates files for every terminal session, regardless of importance, quickly filling storage with low-value content.
2. **Quality Control**: Many terminal sessions are trivial or exploratory and don't merit documentation.
3. **Organization Challenges**: Auto-generated files lack meaningful context and require significant post-processing.
4. **Documentation Focus**: Effective documentation is deliberate and focused, not exhaustive.

Instead, this guide introduces a session management approach that lets you:
- Selectively record only noteworthy terminal sessions
- Create properly named and formatted session records
- Maintain organized documentation without clutter
- Easily clean up old or redundant session files

## The Warp Session Manager Script

The `warp-session-manager.sh` script provides a comprehensive interface for managing Warp AI terminal sessions.

### Installation

The script is located at `~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh` and requires executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x ~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh
```

### Basic Usage

The script supports the following commands:

1. **View Help**
   ```bash
   ~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh help
   ```

2. **Start a New Session**
   ```bash
   ~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh start "SSH Configuration Guide"
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   SUCCESS: Started new session: SSH Configuration Guide
   INFO: Recording to: /home/donaldtanner/Documents/warp-ai-sessions/20250407-134512_SSH-Configuration-Guide.md
   ```

3. **Check Session Status**
   ```bash
   ~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh status
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   INFO: Active session: SSH Configuration Guide
   INFO: Recording to: /home/donaldtanner/Documents/warp-ai-sessions/20250407-134512_SSH-Configuration-Guide.md
   INFO: Started on: 2025-04-07 13:45:12
   ```

4. **List All Sessions**
   ```bash
   ~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh list
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Warp AI Sessions:
   -----------------
   * 2025-04-07 13:45:12 - SSH Configuration Guide
     2025-04-07 12:32:45 - Backup System Implementation
     2025-04-06 09:15:22 - Git Workflow Documentation
   ```

5. **Stop Current Session**
   ```bash
   ~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh stop
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   SUCCESS: Stopped and saved session: 20250407-134512_SSH-Configuration-Guide.md
   ```

6. **Clean Up Old Sessions**
   ```bash
   ~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh cleanup 30
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   The following sessions are older than 30 days:
     20250305-102215_Docker-Container-Setup.md
     20250301-153022_Database-Backup-Process.md
   Delete these 2 sessions? [y/N] y
   SUCCESS: Removed 2 old session files.
   ```

## Best Practices for Session Management

### When to Start a New Session

Start a new recording session when:
- Working on a specific, well-defined task or tutorial
- Implementing a solution you want to document for future reference
- Troubleshooting a complex issue that others might encounter
- Learning a new tool or technique worth preserving

### Choosing Descriptive Session Names

Good session names:
- Are concise but descriptive (e.g., "MongoDB Schema Migration")
- Include the purpose or context (e.g., "Setting Up SSH Key Authentication")
- Avoid generic terms like "Test" or "New Session"

### During an Active Session

While a session is active:
- Include clear comments about what you're doing
- Take time to explain complex commands
- When making mistakes, document them and the corrections
- Keep the session focused on a single topic

### Session Cleanup Strategy

Recommended cleanup approach:
- Keep sessions for at least 30 days by default
- Archive particularly valuable sessions to your documentation site
- Run `cleanup` monthly to prevent storage bloat
- Before deleting, review sessions to identify any worth preserving

## Example Workflows

### Documenting Software Installation

```bash
# Start a new session for documenting PostgreSQL installation
~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh start "PostgreSQL 15 Installation on Ubuntu 24.04"

# Proceed with installation commands and documentation
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql-15
# ... other commands ...

# Check the status
systemctl status postgresql

# Add explanatory notes directly in the terminal
echo "# Note: The default configuration file is at /etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf"

# When finished, stop the session
~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh stop
```

### Troubleshooting and Resolution Documentation

```bash
# Start a troubleshooting session
~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh start "Network Connectivity Issues Resolution"

# Document the problem
echo "# Issue: Unable to connect to external API endpoints from application server"

# Show the diagnostic process
ping api.example.com
traceroute api.example.com
sudo iptables -L

# Document the solution
echo "# Solution: Firewall rule was blocking outbound HTTPS traffic"
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
sudo netfilter-persistent save

# Verify the fix
curl -I https://api.example.com

# Stop the session
~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh stop
```

### Making Sessions Part of Your Documentation

After creating valuable session records, you can:

1. Copy them to your GitHub Pages documentation site:
   ```bash
   cp ~/Documents/warp-ai-sessions/20250407-134512_SSH-Configuration-Guide.md docs/ssh/guides/
   ```

2. Edit them to improve formatting and clarity

3. Commit them to your documentation repository:
   ```bash
   git add docs/ssh/guides/
   git commit -m "Add SSH configuration guide from terminal session"
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

## Adding Session Manager to Your PATH

For easier access, consider adding this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
# Add alias for warp session management
alias wsm="~/bin/warp-session-manager.sh"
```

This allows you to use simplified commands like:
```bash
wsm start "New Project Setup"
wsm status
wsm stop
```

## Conclusion

By using this session management approach, you can create high-quality, focused documentation from your terminal sessions without the clutter of automatic recording. This selective approach results in more useful documentation that focuses on what matters.
