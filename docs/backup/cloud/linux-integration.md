## Integration Testing Recommendations
1. Most Fedora-friendly (in order):
   - SpiderOak One: Native RPM, no extra dependencies
   - pCloud: Simple AppImage deployment
   - CrashPlan: RPM but requires Java
   - Wasabi: Requires additional tool setup

2. Reliability Considerations:
   - All solutions have proven Fedora compatibility
   - SpiderOak and pCloud offer most native experience
   - Wasabi requires more setup but offers most flexibility
   - CrashPlan's Java requirement may impact performance

3. API/Bucket Management:
   - Wasabi: Most flexible with S3 API
   - Others: Limited to vendor API

Next Steps: Proceed to macOS Integration Testing
