# Backup Strategy Project Status

## Project Dependenci**Project Name:** Comprehensive Backup Strategy

**Description:** Documentation and implementation of a multi-layered
backup approach using Borg as the primary tool for both local and cloud
repositories, supplemented by Duplicity+B2, and Dropbox as a selective
cloud solution\
**Created:** 2025-04-07\
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-07\
**Status:** Active - Implementation Phase\
**Location:** \~/Documents/backup-strategy\
**Author:** Donald Tanner\
**Version:** 1.1.0

## Status Summary

The project has successfully established a comprehensive backup strategy
with Borg as the cornerstone for both local and cloud repositories. This
is complemented by Duplicity+B2 for additional cloud backup
capabilities, and a specialized Dropbox setup with shell functions for
selective file synchronization. Documentation has been restructured to
better reflect this layered approach, with emphasis on our robust Borg
implementation.
