## Introduction

Modern data protection requires a comprehensive backup strategy that addresses multiple failure scenarios and recovery needs. This document outlines our multi-layered backup approach using:

1. **Primary Systems**: Duplicity, Borg, and B2 for comprehensive automated backups
2. **Standalone System**: Dropbox with shell functions and aliases for quick access
3. **Additional Solution**: DeJa Dup with Google Drive for supplementary coverage

By combining these diverse solutions, we create a robust backup strategy that provides quick local recovery, secure off-site storage, and convenient access across multiple devices.
