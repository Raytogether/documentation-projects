Let's create a configuration entry in the SSH config file with common settings and an easy-to-remember alias.
Great! I've set up your SSH config file for easier connections. Here's what's been configured:

1. Created ~/.ssh/config with secure permissions (600)
2. Added a convenient alias 'homeserver' with the following features:
•  Easy connection using just ssh homeserver
•  Automatic user and key selection
•  Connection keepalive settings
•  Security optimizations

How to use it:
Instead of typing ssh donald@10.0.0.215, you can now simply use:

ssh homeserver

cat > ~/.ssh/config << 'EOF'
# Home server configuration
Host homeserver
    HostName 10.0.0.215
    User donald
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    Port 22
    # Performance and security options
    Compression yes
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
    # Security options
    HashKnownHosts yes
    StrictHostKeyChecking yes
EOF

The configuration includes:
•  Compression: Enables data compression for better performance
•  ServerAliveInterval: Keeps connections alive by sending a packet every 60 seconds
•  ServerAliveCountMax: Disconnects after 3 failed keepalive attempts
•  HashKnownHosts: Increases security by hashing host entries
•  StrictHostKeyChecking: Enforces strict host key checking

To add more servers, just add new Host sections with different names.
Example template:

Host nickname
    HostName actual.hostname.or.ip
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/specific_key
