## Introduction

This documentation chronicles a learning journey focused on system monitoring, from basic Bash scripting to advanced C-based application development with GKrellm. The project combines theoretical learning with practical implementation, demonstrating real-world performance improvements in system monitoring techniques.

The journey is structured as a progressive path through different programming languages and paradigms, with each stage building on skills from the previous one. The documentation also details specific technical achievements, particularly in the area of efficient system monitoring through direct sysfs filesystem access rather than using external commands.

By following this path, readers can learn how to develop increasingly sophisticated system monitoring tools, understand Linux hardware monitoring interfaces, and contribute to open-source projects like GKrellm.

## Learning Path Overview

The journey follows a structured learning path through multiple programming languages and paradigms:

1. **Bash Scripting**: Starting with shell scripting to develop fundamental system interaction skills
2. **Python Development**: Moving to a higher-level language with object-oriented features and GUI capabilities
3. **C Programming**: Learning system-level programming for performance-critical applications
4. **GKrellm Project**: Applying all skills to study, fork, and modernize the GKrellm system monitor

This progressive approach allows for building practical skills at each stage while working toward the ultimate goal of contributing to a sophisticated system monitoring application.
